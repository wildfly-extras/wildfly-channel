### Summary

This document describes the overall architecture and concepts related to Channels to provision WildFly.

## Concepts

### Provisioning Concepts

WildFly uses Galleon to provision and update its installation.
All concepts related to Galleon are defined in https://docs.wildfly.org/galleon/[its documentation]

### Component Version

It is out of scope of this document to define how WildFly and the components it incorporates are versioned.
However, channels are referencing Maven versions. A channel can specify a pattern of version and pick the “latest” version that matches that pattern. 

This "latest" version is determined by comparing all the versions and returns the last one using the
`org.wildfly.channel.version.VersionMatcher.getLatestVersion(Set<String> versions)` method.

[NOTE]
====
This provides a deterministic way to find the "latest" version. However, it is out of scope of this specification to capture all the
different version patterns. Our recommendation is to specify a pattern in `versionPattern` that constrains as much as possible the set of versions
to compare before determine the latest ones among them.
====

### Channel Compatibility

Backwards compatibility is only guaranteed inside a single channel. If an installation subscribes to multiple channels, the backwards compatibility of the whole installation is not guaranteed.

## Channel Model

Channel combines a Channel Manifest defining content of channel, one or more Repositories from which the content can be resolved and an optional Blocklist Manifest.


### Channel definition
A channel is composed of several fields:

* An optional `name` that is a human-readable one-line description of the channel (`Channel for WildFly 27`)
* An optional `description` that provides human-readable description of the channel
* An optional `vendor` that defines who provides the channel and their support level. This field is descriptive only and is not used to enforce any mechanism. This field is composed of:
** A required `name` to identify the vendor (eg `WildFly Community Project`)
** A required `support` type that accepts the following values:
*** `supported` - Components provided by this channel are supported by the vendor. Some features provided by this channel can still be considered as tech-preview.
*** `tech-preview` - Feature provided by this channel are Tech Preview by the vendor
*** `community` - Components provided by this channel are a community effort  from the vendor
* A collection of `repositories` that defines repositories associated with the channel. Only listed repositories are used to resolve channel's components. Each repository is composed of:
** A required `id` that defines the repository name used in Maven cache
** A required `url` pointing to a default Maven repository
* Optional `manifest` corresponding to the Channel Manifest artifact. Channel Manifest is used to define streams available in the channel.
** One of the following, mutually exclusive fields, used to resolve the Channel Manifest:
*** `maven` corresponds to Maven coordinates of the Manifest. It's composed of:
**** Mandatory `groupId` and `artifactId` elements that are the Maven coordinates of the manifest.
**** Optional `version` to stick to a given manifest version (instead of requiring the latest version of that manifest). In the absence of this `version`, the latest version of the manifest will be determined based on the Maven repository metadata (see <<Component Version>>).
*** `url` corresponding to a URL where the manifest file can be found.
*** `signature-url` corresponding to a URL where the signature of the manifest file can be found.
* Optional `blocklist` corresponding to the Blocklist artifact. Blocklist is used to define versions of artifacts excluded from a channel.
** One of the following, mutually exclusive fields, used to resolve the Blocklist:
*** `maven` corresponds to Maven coordinates of the Blocklist. It's composed of:
**** Mandatory `groupId` and `artifactId` elements that are the Maven coordinates of the blocklist.
**** Optional `version` to stick to a given blocklist version (instead of requiring the latest version of that blocklist). In the absence of this `version`, the latest version of the blocklist will be determined based on the Maven repository metadata (see <<Component Version>>).
*** `url` corresponding to a URL where the blocklist file can be found.
* An optional `resolve-if-no-stream` that defines strategy for version resolution if the artifact has not been found in the `streams` collection or if the channel didn't declare a manifest. Allowed values are:
** `latest` - use the latest version found in the Maven repositories (using mechanism described in <<Component Version>>)
** `maven-latest` - a version marked as `latest` in the Maven metadata
** `maven-release` - a version marked as `release` in the Maven metadata
** `none` - do not attempt to resolve versions of artifact not listed in the `streams` collection. Default value if no strategy is provided.
* Optional `gpg-check` boolean indicating that during artifact resolution, this channel will verify a signature of every artifact. If the artifact signature cannot be found, or cannot be validated, the artifact will not be resolved from the channel. The channel repositories must contain a detached GPG signature paired with the artifact as described below.
* Optional `gpg-urls` a list of URLs that the public GPG keys used to validate artifact signatures are resolved from.

### Manifest definition
A Channel Manifest is composed of following fields:

* An optional `name` that is a human-readable one-line description of the channel (`manifest for WildFly 27`)
* An optional `id` element that is used to identify channel.
* An optional `description` that provides human-readable description of the channel
* An optional `logical-version` that provides a human-readable short description of the version of the manifest. Note this may, but doesn't need to correspond to the Maven version of the artifact (from Manifest schema 1.1.0).
* A collection of `requires`. Each element of that list corresponds to another channel that is required to provision components from this channel.
This field can be used for layered products to enforce their dependencies so that the installation only need to update the top level channel to get updates from all required channels.
Each element is composed of:
** Mandatory `id` element corresponding to the ID of required manifest.
** Optional `maven` element representing Maven coordinates the required manifest is published at.
*** Mandatory `groupId` and `artifactId` elements.
*** Optional `version` to stick to a given manifest version (instead of requiring the latest version of that manifest). In the absence of this `version`, the latest version of the manifest will be determined based on the Maven repository metadata.
* A collection of `streams` that defines all the components installable from this channel. Each stream is composed of:
** A required `groupId` that corresponds to Maven GroupId to pull artifacts (it is not allowed to specify `*` for the groupId).
** A required `artifactId` that corresponds to Maven ArtifactId to pull artifacts. Special syntax `*` can be used to match _any_ artifactId.
** One of the following fields (which are mutually exclusive) that provides rules to resolve the Maven artifacts to provision. At most one field must be present in the stream definition.
*** `versionPattern` corresponds to a Pattern through which the available versions are matched (e.g. `2\.2\..*`)
*** `version` corresponds to a single version (e.g. `2.2.Final`)

### Blocklist definition
* A collection of `blocks` that defines all the component versions excluded from version resolution. Each exclusion is composed of:
** A required `groupId` that corresponds to Maven GroupId of the excluded artifacts (it is not allowed to specify `*` for the groupId).
** A required `artifactId` that corresponds to Maven ArtifactId of the excluded artifacts. Special syntax `*` can be used to match _any_ artifactId.
** A required list of `versions` corresponding to excluded version (e.g. `[2.2.Final, 2.2.1.Final]`)

## Channel Schema

JSON Schemas are provided to validate that channels and manifests comply with the model described above.

## Channel Representation

A channel is specified in the YAML language with a link:../core/src/main/resources/org/wildfly/channel/v2.0.0/schema.json[corresponding JSON schema] to validate its structure.

A manifest is specified in the YAML language with a link:../core/src/main/resources/org/wildfly/manifest/v1.0.0/schema.json[corresponding JSON schema] to validate its structure.

A blocklist is specified in the YAML language with a link:../core/src/main/resources/org/wildfly/blocklist/v1.0.0/schema.json[corresponding JSON schema] to validate its structure.

### Channel Actions and Responsibilities

#### Create a channel

A minimal Channel definition is a single file that complies with the channel YAML representation. The Channel definition may reference two additional resources: a Manifest file and a Blocklist file.

Creating a channel corresponds to the creation of the above files.

#### Publish a channel
A channel may be “published” so that it can be read (or downloaded) by WildFly provisioning tooling.
Channels are published as a Maven artifact with the classifier `channel` and extension/type `yaml`.

If the Channel uses maven coordinates to reference Manifest and/or Blocklist, those files must be "published" in one of the repositories defined in the Channel so that the Channel is able to resolve them. Otherwise, those files must be made available at the URLs defined by the Channel.

When manifests are published as Maven artifacts, they must use the classifier `manifest` and extension/type `yaml`.

When blocklists are published as Maven artifacts, they must use the classifier `blocklist` and extension/type `yaml`.

#### Update a channel

A channel definition and manifest can be updated to add or modify streams, change its requirements, etc. Each of the channel files can be updated independently of each other.

To update a channel file, it needs to be published with a new version.

#### Consume a channel
The main consumers of WildFly Channels are the provisioning tooling provided by the WildFly project.

They consume channels by pulling the channel artifact corresponding to the `groupId`/`artifactId` of a channel. If a `version` is specified, the channel corresponding to that version is pulled. Otherwise, the latest version of the channel is determined based on the Maven metadata from the repository that hosts the channel artifacts.

#### Resolving channel manifest

The manifest is resolved when a channel is initialized. The channel can omit the manifest definition in which case the `resolve-if-no-stream` strategy will be used to resolve artifacts.

If the channel defines a manifest using URL, the manifest will be read from that location. If instead maven coordinates are used, the specified version of manifest is resolved from the channel's repositories. If only `groupId` and `artifactId` is provided, the latest available version of the channel manifest (as defined in <<Component Version>>) will be used.

If the chanel defines a manifest, but no manifest can be resolved (using either URL or GA[V]), an error will be thrown.

#### Resolving required channels

Required channels are identified by their manifests' ID. If multiple channels are used in the channel session, the required IDs are first resolved from the list of channels.

If an ID cannot be resolved in this way, and the requirement provides `maven` element, a resolution will be attempted using provided maven coordinates. The parent channel's repositories will be used to resolve the new manifest and the created channel will inherit repository settings from the parent channel.

If the resolution cannot be achieved, an error will be thrown.

If the required channels form a cycle, an error will be thrown.

If the set of channels contains non-unique manifest IDs, an error will be thrown.

### Maven Artifact resolution

A Maven artifact can be resolved through a channel.
Such a resolution will use the Maven repositories defined within the channel. If a channel `requires` a different channel, the required channel will use the repositories from its own definition.

The channels will be searched for a stream that matches the `groupId`/`artifactId` of the artifact.

If a channel directly defines a stream that matches the groupId/artifactId of the artifact, the version will be resolved from this stream.

If channel does not directly define a stream, required channels will be searched. The latest version of the stream found in the required channels will be used.

If multiple channels are defined, the latest version from any channel that defines the stream (directly or through required channels) is used. Channel which manifests are `required` by another channel, are excluded from a direct search.

If no stream that matches the artifact have been found, version is resolved using fallback strategy defined in `resolve-if-no-stream` for the channel.
An error is returned to the caller if:

* the fallback strategy is `none`
* the fallback strategy is `latest`, `maven-latest` or `maven-release` but underlying Maven repository contains no metadata for artifacts with required `groupId` and `artifactId`

If the stream defines a `version`, the artifact will be resolved based on this version. If that version of the artifact can not be pulled
from the Maven repositories, an error is returned to the caller.
If the stream defines a `versionPattern`, the version will be determined by querying the version of the artifacts from the
Maven repositories and use the latest version that matches the pattern. If no version matches the pattern, an error is returned to the caller.

#### Maven repository proxies

A channel defines repositories using their `id` and a default `url`. When creating the channel from definition the provisioning tool can replace the provided `url` with URL of a proxy server or an alternative repository. The `id` of the repository must not be changed.

### Blocking artifact versions
When using an open channel, a situation may arise where certain artifacts are promoted to the channel and later discovered to be invalid. As it’s impossible to remove artifacts already deployed into a repository, those versions have to blocklisted.

#### Format
The blocklist file contains a list of stream Maven coordinates with multiple versions:
```
---
blocks:
- groupId: io.undertow
  artifactId: undertow-core
  versions:
  - 2.2.18.Final
  - 2.2.17.Final
…
```
The artifactId can use a wildcard syntax to refer to all the artifacts with the same groupId
```
---
blocks:
- groupId: io.undertow
  artifactId: “*”
  versions:
  - 2.2.18.Final
  - 2.2.17.Final
```

#### Resolving channel blocklist

The blocklist is resolved when a channel is initialized.

If the channel defines a blocklist using URL, the blocklist will be read from that location. If instead maven coordinates are used, the specified version of manifest is resolved from the channel's repositories. If only `groupId` and `artifactId` is provided, the latest available version of the blocklist (as defined in <<Component Version>>) will be used.

If no blocklist artifact can be resolved with supplied Maven coordinates, the channel treats it as an empty blocklist.

A blocklist applies only to the channel that defined it, not its required channels.

#### Resolving artifact version

During artifact version resolution, a stream matching artifact GA is located in the channel. The blocklist is always checked for excluded versions, except when using `resolveDirectMavenArtifact` method. The excluded versions are removed from the set of available artifact versions before the latest remaining version matching the stream’s pattern is used to resolve the artifact. If the blocklist excludes all available artifact versions, `UnresolvedMavenArtifactException` is thrown.

### Verifying artifact PGP signatures

If a channel sets value of `gpg-check` property to `true`, any artifact resolved from it (including the manifest itself) must have a valid GPG signature.

#### Verifying Maven artifact signatures

Maven artifacts are expected to have their detached GPG signatures available in the channel repositories. The detached artifacts must have the same GAV as the artifact, but append ".asc" suffix to the file extension. The signature file must contain an armoured GPG signature.

The signature file is resolved at the same time as the artifact. If the signature is invalid, the public key is not found, the public key is expired or revoked, the artifact must be rejected and a SignatureException must be thrown.

#### Verifying manifest signatures

If the manifest of a channel is defined as a Maven GA(V), it is treated as any other maven artifact. If it is defined as an URL, the signature file must be available at the same URL with ".asc" suffix. Alternatively, a `signature-url` element can be used to provide a location of the signature. If the signature cannot be resolved, the channel creation must fail.

#### Public keys

The public keys are identified by the a keyID in hexadecimal form. The public keys required by the channel can be defined using `gpg-urls` property. Each `gpg-urls` must be a URL to a downloadable key.

Implementations may provide additional means of providing keys - local stores, remote keyservers, etc.
